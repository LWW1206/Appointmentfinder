# AppointmentFinder - Webscripting (WEBSC)
Group project for second semester course "Webscripting" (WEBSC) at UAS Technikum Wien.

Authors: Matthias Kemmer, Li Wen Wang

### Task
The task was to create a website that is designed to help groups of people find the best date for their event or meeting. Multiple users can vote on provided dates, making it easier for them to find a date that works for everyone. In addition users can create their own votings by providing a list of dates. The votings have a start and end date and time. The option with the most user votes is considered to be the best date for the whole group.

The Frontend uses Bootstrap as a framework, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the Backend uses XAMPP tech stack (cross-plattform, Apache webserver, MariaDB and PHP). The communication between Frontend and Backend uses AJAX calls.
